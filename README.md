## Introduction

simple sauvetage game with a dynamic environment BETA = 0.1 # softmax parameter EPSILON = 0.5 # probability of random choice EPS_FACTOR = 0.99 # Every episode will be epsilon\*EPS_DECAY LEARNING_RATE = 0.4 # learning rate DISCOUNT = 0.8 # discount factor proba_pitfall = 0.7 # probability of having a pitfall fire_prob_spread = 0.3 # probability of fire spreading
